## Goal

The goal of this project is to explore bias in datasets. To that end, the project involves the following steps: constructing, analyzing, and publishing a dataset of article quality scores for wikipedia articles, as generated by the ORES Liftwing model, for a list of politicans from around the world.

## Repository Structure 

This repository has the following structure, generated by the tree command in linux.

## Data Source, Documentation, and Licensure

The source data comes from the Wikimedia API, and terms of use for the wikimedia can be found [here](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Terms_of_Use). 

API documentation for the APIs can be found [here](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/API_catalog).

This repository contains two pre-made datasets. 

- politicians_by_country_AUG.2024.csv was generated by crawling the [Wikipedia Politicians by Nationality Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Politicians_by_nationality) to generate politicians from a range of countries.

- population_by_country_AUG.2024.csv was generated from the Population Reference Bureau's [world population data sheet](https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/population/table)

Portions of the source code were sourced, with modifications, from notebooks created by Dr. David W. McDonald for use in DATA 512 licensed via the [Creative Commons BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The original, unaltered notebook code is located in the `src/notebooks` directory. 

## Getting Started 

This project, in the interest of reproducibility, manages required packages and package versions using the python poetry package, documentation for which can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). More thorough information about using poetry can be found at the link provided, but some brief requirements to use poetry for this project are: 
- some interface for the command line
- python
- the pip utility for installing packages 

Once these requirements are fulfilled, install poetry with pip `pip install poetry`, clone this repo, and run
`poetry install` in the base directory of the repo containing the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files. All required packages will be installed into the current environment.

Example commands to run data collection can be found in the `run_scripts.sh` file in the `src/libs` subdirectory in the repo. If you would like to run these commands as is, you will need to set up the bash environment variables `local_machine_scripts_directory`, `data_directory`, `revid_csv_file_name`, `pol_revid_out_file_name`, and  `pol_csv_file_name`. These correspond to the scripts and data directory absolute paths in the local machine version of the repo. Additionally, they correspond to the file names you would like toh ave written out for these commands. These scripts must be run in sequence, with `page_info_api_request.py` run before `ores_api_request.py`. These environment variables can be set in your current shell through the command:
`export VARNAME="value"`
